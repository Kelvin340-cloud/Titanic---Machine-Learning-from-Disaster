# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

The Titanic disaster on April 15, 1912, is one of history's most infamous shipwrecks, claiming 1,502 lives out of 2,224 passengers and crew due to insufficient lifeboats.

This challenge involves building a predictive model to determine which types of people were more likely to survive the tragedy. Using passenger data such as name, age, gender, and socio-economic class, your goal is to uncover patterns and answer the question: “What sorts of people were more likely to survive?”
